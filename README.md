# CNN-for-Flower-Recognition
This code contains a *flower recognizer* which is implemented using the *keras* library.

This CNN model achieves an accuracy of over 74%.

The Dataset is taken from Kaggle , it can be found out here : https://www.kaggle.com/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition .

The architecture of the ConvNet uses multiple convolution layers along with few fully connected layers and an output softmax layer.
